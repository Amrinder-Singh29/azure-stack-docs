## Build 1.1904.0.36

<!-- ### Changes -->

### New features

- For a list of new features in this release, see [this section](../operator/azure-stack-release-notes-1904.md#whats-in-this-update) of the Azure Stack release notes.

### Fixed and known issues

- Due to a service principal timeout when running the registration script, in order to [register the ASDK](asdk-register.md) successfully you must edit the **RegisterWithAzure.psm1** PowerShell script. Do the following:

  1. On the ASDK host computer, open the file **C:\AzureStack-Tools-master\Registration\RegisterWithAzure.psm1** in an editor with elevated permissions.
  2. On line 1249, add a `-TimeoutInSeconds 1800` parameter at the end. This is required due to a service principal timeout when running the registration script. Line 1249 should now appear as follows:

     ```powershell
      $servicePrincipal = Invoke-Command -Session $PSSession -ScriptBlock { New-AzureBridgeServicePrincipal -RefreshToken $using:RefreshToken -AzureEnvironment $using:AzureEnvironmentName -TenantId $using:TenantId -TimeoutInSeconds 1800 }
      ```

- Fixed the VPN connection issue identified in release 1902.

- Note that [available Azure Stack hotfixes](../operator/azure-stack-release-notes-1904.md#hotfixes) are not applicable to the Azure Stack ASDK.
