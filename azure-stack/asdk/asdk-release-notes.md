### Known issues

- There is an issue with establishing a VPN connection from another host into the ASDK using the steps in [this article](asdk-connect.md). When you attempt to connect from your VPN client to the ASDK environment, you will see an error that **The user name or password is incorrect**, even when you're sure you have used the correct account, and typed the password correctly. The issue is not with your credentials, but rather with a change to the authentication protocol used for the VPN connection on the ASDK. To work around this issue, perform the following steps:

   First, make changes to the authentication protocol used on the ASDK server side:

   1. RDP to the ASDK host.
   2. Open an elevated PowerShell session, signing in as AzureStack\AzureStackAdmin, using the password you provided at the time of deployment.
   3. Run the following commands:

      ```powershell
      netsh nps set np name = "Connections to Microsoft Routing and Remote Access server" profileid = "0x100a" profiledata = "1A000000000000000000000000000000" profileid = "0x1009" profiledata = "0x5"
      restart-service remoteaccess -force
      ```

   Next, modify the client-side connection script. The easiest way to do this is to make changes directly to the C:\AzureStack-Tools-master\connect\azurestack.connect.psm1 script module:

   1. Modify the **Add-AzsVpnConnection** cmdlet to change the `AuthenticationMethod` parameter from `MsChapv2` to `EAP`:

      ```powershell
      $connection = Add-VpnConnection -Name $ConnectionName -ServerAddress $ServerAddress -TunnelType L2tp -EncryptionLevel Required -AuthenticationMethod Eap -L2tpPsk $PlainPassword -Force -RememberCredential -PassThru -SplitTunneling
      ```

   2. Change the **Connect-AzsVpn** cmdlet from using `rasdial @ConnectionName $User $PlainPassword` to using `rasphone`, as EAP requires interactive sign in:

      ```powershell
      rasphone $ConnectionName
      ```

   3. Save your changes and then re-import the **azurestack.connect.psm1** module.
   4. Follow the instructions in [this article](asdk-connect.md#set-up-vpn-connectivity).
   5. When you connect to the ASDK via VPN, connect by navigating to the Windows **Network & Internet Settings**, then **VPN**, rather than connecting from the taskbar, to ensure that you are prompted for credentials.

- An issue has been identified in which packets over 1450 bytes to an Internal Load Balancer (ILB) are dropped. The issue is due to the MTU setting on the host being too low to accommodate VXLAN encapsulated packets that traverse the role, which as of 1901 has been moved to the host. There are at least two scenarios that you might encounter in which we have seen this issue manifest itself:

  - SQL queries to SQL Always-On that is behind an Internal Load Balancer (ILB), and are over 660 bytes.
  - Kubernetes deployments fail if you attempt to enable multiple masters.  

  The issue occurs when you have communication between a VM and an ILB in the same virtual network but on different subnets. You can work around this issue by running the following commands in an elevated command prompt on the ASDK host:

  ```shell
  netsh interface ipv4 set sub "hostnic" mtu=1660
  netsh interface ipv4 set sub "management" mtu=1660
  ```

## Build 1.1901.0.95

See the [important build information in the Azure Stack release notes](../operator/azure-stack-update-1901.md#build-reference).

### Changes

This build includes the following improvements for Azure Stack:

- BGP and NAT components are now deployed on the physical host. This eliminates the need to have two public or corporate IP addresses for deploying the ASDK, and also simplifies deployment.
- Azure Stack integrated systems backups can now [be validated](asdk-validate-backup.md) using the **asdk-installer.ps1** PowerShell script.

### New features

- For a list of new features in this release, see [this section](../operator/azure-stack-update-1901.md#new-features) of the Azure Stack release notes.

### Fixed and known issues

- For a list of issues fixed in this release, see [this section](../operator/azure-stack-update-1901.md#fixed-issues) of the Azure Stack release notes. For a list of known issues, see [this section](../operator/azure-stack-update-1901.md#known-issues-post-installation).
- Note that [available Azure Stack hotfixes](../operator/azure-stack-update-1901.md#azure-stack-hotfixes) are not applicable to the Azure Stack ASDK.
