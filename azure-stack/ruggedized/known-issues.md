# Known issues in Azure Stack Hub ruggedized 

This article lists known issues in Azure Stack Hub ruggedized. The list is updated as new issues are identified.

## Update

For known Azure Stack Hub update issues, see [Troubleshooting Updates in Azure Stack Hub](../operator/azure-stack-troubleshooting.md#troubleshoot-azure-stack-hub-updates).

## Portal

### Subscriptions Lock blade

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the administrator portal, the **Lock** blade for user subscriptions has two buttons that say **Subscription**.
- Occurrence: Common

### Subscription permissions

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: You cannot view permissions to your subscription using the Azure Stack Hub portals.
- Remediation: Use [PowerShell to verify permissions](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/get-azurermroleassignment).
- Occurrence: Common

### Storage account settings

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the storage account **Configuration** blade shows an option to change **security transfer type**. The feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Upload blob with OAuth error

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you try to upload a blob using the **OAuth(preview)** option, the task fails with an error message.
- Remediation: Upload the blob using the SAS option.
- Occurrence: Common

### Upload blob option unsupported

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you try to upload a blob in the upload blade, there is an option to select **Azure AD** or **Key Authentication**, however **Azure AD** is not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Load balancer backend pool

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when adding a **Load balancer** backend pool, the operation results in an error message of **Failed to save load balancer backend pool**; however, the operation did actually succeed.
- Occurrence: Common

### Alert for network interface disconnected

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When a cable is disconnected from a network adapter, an alert does not show in the administrator portal. This issue is caused because this fault is disabled by default in Windows Server 2019.
- Occurrence: Common

### Incorrect tooltip when creating VM

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you select a managed disk, with disk type Premium SSD, the drop-down list shows **OS Disk**. The tooltip next to that option says **Certain OS Disk sizes may be available for free with Azure Free Account**; however, this is not valid for Azure Stack Hub. In addition, the list includes **Free account eligible** which is also not valid for Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### VPN troubleshoot and metrics

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the **VPN Troubleshoot** feature and **Metrics** in a VPN gateway resource appears, however this is not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Adding extension to virtual machine scale set

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, once a virtual machine scale set is created, the UI does not permit the user to add an extension.
- Occurrence: Common

### Delete a storage container

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when a user attempts to delete a storage container, the operation fails when the user does not toggle **Override Azure Policy and RBAC Role settings**.
- Remediation: Ensure that the box is checked for **Override Azure Policy and RBAC Role settings**.
- Occurrence: Common

### Refresh button on virtual machines fails

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you navigate to **Virtual Machines** and try to refresh using the button at the top, the states fail to update accurately.
- Remediation: The status is automatically updated every 5 minutes regardless of whether the refresh button has been clicked or not. Wait 5 minutes and check the status.
- Occurrence: Common

### Virtual Network Gateway

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you create a route table, **Virtual Network gateway** appears as one of the next hop type options; however, this is not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Storage account options

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the name of storage accounts is shown as **Storage account - blob, file, table, queue**; however, **file** is not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Storage account configuration

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you create a storage account and view its **Configuration**, you cannot save configuration changes, as it results in an AJAX error.
- Occurrence: Common

### Capacity monitoring in SQL resource provider keeps loading

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases, with SQL resource provider version 1.1.33.0 or earlier installed.
- Cause: The current version of the SQL resource provider is not compatible with some of the latest portal changes.
- Remediation: Follow the resource provider update process to apply the SQL resource provider hotfix 1.1.47.0 after Azure Stack Hub is upgraded to ([SQL RP version 1.1.47.0](https://aka.ms/azurestacksqlrp11470)). For the MySQL resource provider, it is also recommended that you apply the MySQL resource provider hotfix 1.1.47.0 after Azure Stack Hub is upgraded to ([MySQL RP version 1.1.47.0](https://aka.ms/azurestackmysqlrp11470)).
- Occurrence: Common

### Access Control (IAM)

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The IAM extension is out of date. The Ibiza portal that shipped with Azure Stack Hub introduces a new behavior that causes the RBAC extension to fail if the user is opening the **Access Control (IAM)** blade for a subscription that is not selected in the global subscription selector (**Directory + Subscription** in the user portal). The blade displays **Loading** in a loop, and the user cannot add new roles to the subscription. The **Add** blade also displays **Loading** in a loop.
- Remediation: Ensure that the subscription is checked in the **Directory + Subscription** menu. The menu can be accessed from the top of the portal, near the **Notifications** button, or via the shortcut on the **All resources** blade that displays **Don't see a subscription? Open Directory + Subscription settings**. The subscription must be selected in this menu.

## Networking

### Load balancer

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When adding availability set VMs to the backend pool of a load balancer, an error message is displayed on the portal stating **Failed to save load balancer backend pool**. This is a cosmetic issue on the portal; the functionality is still in place and VMs are successfully added to the backend pool internally.
- Occurrence: Common

### Network Security Groups

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases. 
- Cause: An explicit **DenyAllOutbound** rule cannot be created in an NSG as this will prevent all internal communication to infrastructure needed for the VM deployment to complete.
- Occurrence: Common

### Service endpoints

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the **Virtual Network** blade shows an option to use **Service Endpoints**. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Network interface

#### Adding/removing network interface

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: A new network interface cannot be added to a VM that is in a **running** state.
- Remediation: Stop the virtual machine before adding or removing a network interface.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Primary network interface

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The primary NIC of a VM cannot be changed. Deleting or detaching the primary NIC results in issues when starting up the VM.
- Occurrence: Common

### Virtual Network Gateway

#### Alerts

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the **Virtual Network Gateway** blade shows an option to use **Alerts**. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Active-Active

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, while creating, and in the resource menu of **Virtual Network Gateway**, you will see an option to enable **Active-Active** configuration. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

#### VPN troubleshooter

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the **Connections** blade displays a feature called **VPN Troubleshooter**. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Documentation

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The documentation links in the overview page of Virtual Network gateway link to Azure-specific documentation instead of Azure Stack Hub. Use the following links for the Azure Stack Hub documentation:

  - [Gateway SKUs](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateways.md#gateway-skus)
  - [Highly Available Connections](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateways.md#gateway-availability)
  - [Configure BGP on Azure Stack Hub](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-settings.md#gateway-requirements)
  - [ExpressRoute circuits](../operator/azure-stack-connect-expressroute.md)
  - [Specify custom IPsec/IKE policies](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-settings.md#ipsecike-parameters)

## Compute

### VM boot diagnostics

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When creating a new Windows virtual machine (VM), the following error might be displayed: **Failed to start virtual machine 'vm-name'. Error: Failed to update serial output settings for VM 'vm-name'**. The error occurs if you enable boot diagnostics on a VM, but delete your boot diagnostics storage account.
- Remediation: Recreate the storage account with the same name you used previously.
- Occurrence: Common

### Consumed compute quota

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When creating a new virtual machine, you may receive an error such as **This subscription is at capacity for Total Regional vCPUs on this location. This subscription is using all 50 Total Regional vCPUs available.**. This indicates that the quota for total cores available to you has been reached.
- Remediation: Ask your operator for an add-on plan with additional quota. Editing the current plan's quota will not work or reflect increased quota.
- Occurrence: Rare

### Privileged Endpoint

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: Unable to connect to the Privileged Endpoint (ERC VMs) from a computer running a non-English version of Windows.
- Remediation: This is a known issue that has been fixed in later releases. As a workaround you can run the **New-PSSession** and **Enter-PSSession** PowerShell cmdlets using the **en-US** culture; for examples, set the culture using this script: https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9780596528492/blob/master/Use-Culture.ps1. You will need access to the O'Reilly library.
- Occurrence: Rare

### Virtual machine scale set

#### Create failures during patch and update on 4-node Azure Stack Hub environments

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: Creating VMs in an availability set of 3 fault domains and creating a virtual machine scale set instance fails with a **FabricVmPlacementErrorUnsupportedFaultDomainSize** error during the update process on a 4-node Azure Stack Hub environment.
- Remediation: You can create single VMs in an availability set with 2 fault domains successfully. However, scale set instance creation is still not available during the update process on a 4-node Azure Stack Hub deployment.
