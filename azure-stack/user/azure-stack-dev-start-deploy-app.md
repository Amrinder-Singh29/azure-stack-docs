# Common deployments for Azure Stack

Azure Stack supports both infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). This article lists resources for setting up a virtual machine (VM) and then deploying it to Azure Stack.

## Before you begin

Before you begin to deploy an app to Azure Stack, set up your development machine. For instructions on getting ready to work with Azure Stack as a developer, see [Set up a development environment in Azure Stack](azure-stack-dev-start.md).

## Deploy an app to a VM

In the following how-to articles, you set up a virtual machine (VM) in Azure Stack and then deploy your app from your development workstation to Azure Stack.

- [.NET Core (C#)](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-vm-dotnet.md)
- [Java](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-vm-java.md)
- [Go](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-vm-go.md)
- [Ruby](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-vm-ruby.md)
- [Python](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-vm-python.md)
- [NodeJS](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-vm-nodejs.md)

## Next steps
