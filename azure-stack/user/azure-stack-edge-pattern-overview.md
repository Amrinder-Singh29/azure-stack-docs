# Intelligent Edge patterns

## Overview of the Intelligent Edge patterns

Microsoft Azure Stack is an extension of Azure. Azure Stack brings the agility and innovation of cloud computing to your on-premises environment. It is the only hybrid cloud that lets you build and deploy hybrid apps anywhere.

The white paper Design Considerations for Hybrid Applications reviews pillars of software quality (placement, scalability, availability, resiliency, manageability, and security) for designing, deploying, and operating hybrid applications. The design considerations assist in optimizing hybrid application design which minimize challenges in production environments.
