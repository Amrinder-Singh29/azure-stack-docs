# Deploy a Linux VM to host a web app in Azure Stack

You can create and deploy a basic Linux VM using the Ubunutu image in the marketplace to host your web app created with a web framework. This VM can host web apps using:

- **Python**. Common Python web frameworks include Flask, Bottle, and Django.
- **Go**. Common Go frameworks include Revel, Martini, Gocraft/web, and Gorilla. 
- **Ruby**. You can set up a Ruby on Rails as a framework to deliver your Ruby web apps. 
- **Java**. Java can be used to develop web apps posted to an Apache Tomcat Server. You can install Tomcat on Linux, and then deploy your Java WAR files directly to the server. 

You can use the instructions in this article to get up and running with any web app, framework, and back-end technology that uses the Linux OS. You can then use Azure Stack to manage your infrastructure, and the management tools within your technology to handle maintenance tasks for your app.

## Deploy a Linux VM for a web app

You will create a secret key, use the base image of the Linux VM, specify the particular attributes of the VM, and then create the VM. When the VM has been created, you will open the ports you will need to work with the VM and for the VM to host your app. You will also create the DNS name. Finally, you will connect to the VM and update the machine using apt-get. When you are done with this how to article, you will have a VM in your Azure Stack ready to host your web app.

You can jump right into the instructions, or you may want to make sure you have everything you need in place.

## Prerequisites and considerations

- You will need an Azure Stack subscription.
- Your subscription will need access to the **Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS** image. You can use a later version of the image, but these instructions are written with the 16.04 LTS in mind. If you do not have this image, talk to your cloud operator to get the image into your Azure Stack marketplace.

<!-- Azure Stack specific considerations

### Authentication

Azure Stack works with two identity management services, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Active Directory Federated Services (AD FS).  This section addresses how this procedure will work with either version.

### Connectivity

Azure Stack can be run in connected to completely disconnected scenarios. This section addresses considerations about the use case in relation to connectivity.

### Azure Stack Development Kit and Integrated Systems

While the two version of the product are the same product both version behave differently. Call out considerations about either version. 

### Azure Stack version

Place any version specific calls outs. The procedure will contain steps for the latest version. This section will contain call outs for previous version that are still supported. -->

## Deploy VM using the portal

Create an SSH public key for your server using an app such as Putty. Access your Azure Stack portal, add the Ubuntu server. Set up your network and DNS entry. Connect to your server to update it.

### Create your VM

1. Create an SSH public key for your server. For more information, see [How to use an SSH public key](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-ssh-public-key.md).
2. Open your Azure Stack portal.
3. Select **Create a resource** > **Compute** > **Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS**.

4. In the **Create a virtual machine** blade, for **1. Configure basic settings**:
    1. Type the **Name of your VM**.
    1. Select the **VM disc type**, either **Premium SSD** or **Standard HDD**.
    1. Type your **Username**.
    1. Select the **Authentication type** as **SSH Public key**.
    1. Retrieve the SSH public key that you created. Open it in a text editor, and then copy the key, and past it into the **SSH public key** box. Include the text from `---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----` to `---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----`. Paste the entire block of text into the key box:
       ```text  
            ---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
            Comment: "rsa-key-20190207"
            <Your key block>
            ---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----```
    1. Select your Azure Stack subscription.
    1. Create a new **Resource group** or use an existing depending on how you want to organize the resources for your app.
    1. Select your location. The ASDK is usually in a **local** region. The location will depend on your Azure Stack.
1. For **2. Size** type:
    - Select the size of data and RAM for your VM that is available in your Azure Stack.
    - You can either browse the list or filter for the size of your VM by **Compute type**, **CPUs**, and storage space.
    - Prices presented are estimates in your local currency that include only Azure infrastructure costs and any discounts for the subscription and location. The prices don't include any applicable software costs. Recommended sizes are determined by the publisher of the selected image based on hardware and software requirements.
    - Using a standard disk rather than a premium disk could impact operating system performance.

1. in **3. Configure optional** features type:
    1. For **High availability,** you can select an availability set. To provide redundancy to your application, you can group two or more virtual machines in an availability set. This configuration ensures that during a planned or unplanned maintenance event, at least one virtual machine will be available and meet the 99.95% Azure SLA. The availability set of a virtual machine can't be changed after it is created.
    1. For **Storage** select **Premium disks (SSD)** or **Standard disks (HDD)**. Premium disks (SSD) are backed by solid-state drives and offer consistent, low-latency performance. They provide the best balance between price and performance, and are ideal for I/O-intensive applications and production workloads. Standard disks (HDD) are backed by magnetic drives and are preferable for applications where data is accessed infrequently. Zone- redundant disks are backed by Zone redundant storage (ZRS) that replicates your data across multiple zones and are available even if a single zone is down. 
    1. You can select **Use managed disks**. Enable this feature to have Azure automatically manage the availability of disks to provide data redundancy and fault tolerance, without creating and managing storage accounts on your own. Managed disks may not be available in all regions. For more information, see [Introduction to Azure managed disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/managed-disks-overview).
    1. Select **virtual network** to configure your network. Virtual networks are logically isolated from each other in Azure. You can configure their IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, gateways, and security settings, much like a traditional network in your data center. Virtual machines in the same virtual network can access each other by default. 
    1. Select **subnet** to configure your subnet. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your virtual network, which can be used to isolate virtual machines from each other or from the Internet. 
    1. Select **Public IP address** to configure access to your VM or services running on your VM. Use a public IP address if you want to communicate with the virtual machine from outside the virtual network. 
    1. Select **Network Security Group**, **Basic, or **Advanced**. Set rules that allow or deny network traffic to the VM 
    1. Select **public inbound ports** to set access for common or custom protocols to your VM. The service specifies the destination protocol and port range for this rule. You can choose a predefined service, like RDP or SSH, or provide a custom port range.  
        For the  web server, you are going to want to HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22) open. If you plan on managing the machine with an RDP connection, open port 3389.
    1. Select **Extensions** if you would like to add Extension to your VM. Extensions add new features, like configuration management or antivirus protection, to your virtual machine using extensions. 
    1. Disable or enable **Monitoring**. Capture serial console output and screenshots of the virtual machine running on a host to help diagnose startup issues. 
    1. Select **diagnostics storage account** to specify the storage account holding your metrics. Metrics are written to a storage account so you can analyze them with your own tools. . 
    1. Select **OK**.
1. Review **4. Summary**:
    - The portal validates your settings.
    - You can download the Azure Resource Manager template for your VM if you would like to reuse your settings with an Azure Resource Manager workflow.
    - Press **OK** when the validation has passed. The deployment of the VM takes several minutes.

### Specify the open ports and DNS name

You will want to make your web app accessible to users on your network by opening the ports used to connect to the machine and adding a friendly DNS name such as `mywebapp.local.cloudapp.azurestack.external` that users can use in their web browsers.

#### Open inbound ports

You can modify the destination protocol and port range for predefined service, like RDP or SSH or provide a custom port range. For example, you may want to work with the port range of your web framework. GO, for instance, communicates on port 3000.

1. Open the Azure Stack portal for your tenant.
1. Find your VM. You may have pinned the VM to your dashboard, or you can search for the VM in the **Search resources** box.
1. Select **Networking** in your VM blade.
1. Select **Add inbound port** rule to open a port.
1. For Source, leave the default to **Any**.
1. For Source port range, leave the wildcard (*).
1. For Destination port range, add the port you would like to open, such as `3000`.
1. For **Protocol** leave **Any**.
1. For **Action** set to **Allow**.
1. For **Priority** leave for the default.
1. Type a **Name** and **Description** to help you remember why the port is open.
1. Select **Add**.

#### Add a DNS name for your server

In addition, you can create a DNS name for your server, and then users can connect to your web site using a URL.

1. Open the Azure Stack portal for your tenant.
1. Find your VM. You may have pinned the VM to your dashboard, or you can search for the VM in the **Search resources** box.
1. Select **Overview**.
1. Select **Configure** under VM.
1. Select **Dynamic** for **Assignment**.
1. Type the DNS name label such as `mywebapp` so that your full URL will be: `mywebapp.local.cloudapp.azurestack.external` (for an ASDK app).

### Connect via SSH to update your VM

1. On the same network as your Azure Stack, open your SSH client. For more information, see [How to use an SSH public key](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-ssh-public-key.md).
1. Type:
    ```bash  
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get -y upgrade
    ```
