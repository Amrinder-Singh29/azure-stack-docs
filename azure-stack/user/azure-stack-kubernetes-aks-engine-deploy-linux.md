# Install the AKS Engine on Linux in Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

You can use a Linux machine in your Azure Stack to host the AKS Engine in order to deploy and manage a Kubernetes cluster. In this article, we look at preparing the client VM to manage your cluster for both connected and disconnected Azure Stack instances, check the install, and setting up the client VM on the ASDK.

## Prepare the client VM

The AKS Engine is a command-line tool used to deploy and manage your Kubernetes cluster. You can run the engine on a machine in your Azure Stack. From this machine, you will execute the AKS Engine to deploy the IaaS resources and software needed to run your cluster. You can then use the machine running the engine to perform management tasks on your cluster.

When choosing your client machine, consider:

1. If the client machine should be recoverable in case of a disaster.
2. If you need your client machine to be highly available.
3. How you will connect to the client machine and how the machine will interact with your cluster.

## Install in a connected environment

You can install the client VM to manage your Kubernetes cluster on an Azure Stack connected to the Internet.

1. Create a Linux VM in your Azure Stack. For instructions, see [Quickstart: Create a Linux server VM by using the Azure Stack portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-quick-linux-portal).
2. Connect to your VM.
3. Run the following command:

```bash  
    curl -o get-akse.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/aks-engine/master/scripts/get-akse.sh
    hmod 700 get-akse.sh
    ./get-akse.sh
```

> [!Note]  
> If you method for installation fails, you can try the steps in the [disconnected environment](#install-in-a-disconnected-environment), or [Try GoFish](azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-troubleshoot.md#try-gofish), an alternate package manager.

## Install in a disconnected environment

You can install the client VM to manage your Kubernetes cluster on an Azure Stack disconnected from the Internet.

1.  From a machine with access to the Internet, go to GitHub [Azure/aks-engine](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/releases/latest). Download an archive (*.tar.gz) for a Linux machine, for example, `aks-engine-v0.xx.x-linux-amd64.tar.gz`.

2.  Create a storage account in your Azure Stack instance to upload the archive file (*.tar.gz) with the AKS Engine binary. For instructions on using the Azure Storage Explorer, see [Azure Storage Explorer with Azure Stack](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-storage-connect-se).

3. Create a Linux VM in your Azure Stack. For instructions, see [Quickstart: Create a Linux server VM by using the Azure Stack portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-quick-linux-portal).

3.  From the Azure Stack storage account blob URL where you uploaded the archive file (*.tar.gz), download the file to your management VM. Extract the archive to the directory `/usr/local/bin`.

4. Connect to your VM.

5.  Run the following command:

```bash  
curl -o aks-engine-v0.xx.x-linux-amd64.tar.gz <httpurl/aks-engine-v0.xx.x-linux-amd64.tar.gz>
     tar xvzf aks-engine-v0.xx.x-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
```

## Verify the installation

Once your client VM is set up, check that you have installed the AKS engine.

1. Connect to your client VM.
2. Run the following command:

    ```bash  
    aks-engine version
    ```

If you are unable to verify that you have installed the AKS Engine on your client VM, see [Troubleshoot AKS engine install](azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-troubleshoot.md)


## ASDK installation

You will need to add a certificate when running the client VM for the AKS engine on the ASDK.

When you are using an ASDK your Azure Resource Manager endpoint is using a self-signed certificate, you need explicitly to add this certificate to the machineâ€™s trusted certificate store. You can find the ASDK root certificate in any VM you deploy in the ASDK. For example, in an Ubuntu VM you will find it in this directory `/var/lib/waagent/Certificates.pem`. 

Copy the certificate file with the following command:

```bash
sudo cp /var/lib/waagent/Certificates.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/azurestackca.crt

sudo update-ca-certificates
```
