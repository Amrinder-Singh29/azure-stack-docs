# Overview of IoT Hub on Azure Stack Hub

IoT Hub on Azure Stack Hub allows you to create hybrid IoT solutions. IoT Hub is a managed service, acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use IoT Hub on Azure Stack Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between IoT devices and a on-prem solution backend.

## Differences between IoT Hub on Azure Cloud and IoT Hub on Azure Stack

| Aspect | IoT Hub on Cloud | IoT Hub on Stack |
|-|-|-|
| Message Consumption | https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-read-builtin |By default, messages are routed to the built-in service-facing endpoint (messages/events) that is compatible with Event Hubs. On Azure cloud, you can access the messages from the end point by providing either IoT Hub connection string or Event Hub connection string. However, on Azure Stack hub, only event hub connection string is supported. |
