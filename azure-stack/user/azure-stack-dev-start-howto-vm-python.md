# How to deploy a Python web app to a VM in Azure Stack

You can create a VM to host your Python Web app in Azure Stack. This article looks at the steps you will follow in setting up server, configuring the server to host your Python web app, and then deploying your app.

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. To learn the Python programming language and find additional resources for Python, see [Python.org](https://www.python.org).

This article will use Python 3.x running Flask in a virtual environment on a Ngnix server.

## Create a VM

1. Set up your VM set up in Azure Stack. Follow the steps in [Deploy a Linux VM to host a web app in Azure Stack](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-deploy-linux.md).

2. In the VM network blade, make sure the following ports are accessible:

    | Port | Protocol | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 80 | HTTP | Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. Clients will connect to your web app with either the public IP or DNS name of your VM. |
    | 443 | HTTPS | Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network. Clients will connect to your web app with the either the public IP or DNS name of your VM. |
    | 22 | SSH | Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. You will use this connection with an SSH client to configure the VM and deploy the app. |
    | 3389 | RDP | Optional. The Remote Desktop Protocol allows for a remote desktop connection to use a graphic user interface your machine.   |
    | 5000, 8000 | Custom | Ports  5000, 8000 are used by the Flask web framework in development. For a production server, you will want to route your traffic through 80 and 443. |

## Install Python

1. Connect to your VM using your SSH client. For instructions, see [Connect via SSH with PuTTy](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-ssh-public-key.md#connect-via-ssh-with-putty).
2. At your bash prompt on your VM, type the following commands:

    ```bash  
    sudo apt-get -y install python3 python3-venv python3-dev
    ```

3. Validate your installation. Still connected to your VM in your SSH session, type the following commands:

    ```bash  
        python -version
    ```


3. Install Nginx. [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) is a web server, which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. Still connected to your VM in your SSH session, type the following commands:

    ```bash  
       sudo apt-get -y install nginx git
    ```

4. Install Git. [Git](https://git-scm.com) is a widely distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system. Still connected to your VM in your SSH session, type the following commands:

    ```bash  
       sudo apt-get -y install git
    ```

## Deploy and run the app

1. Set up your Git repository on the VM. Still connected to your VM in your SSH session, type the following commands:

    ```bash  
       git clone https://github.com/mattbriggs/flask-hello-world.git
    
       cd flask-hello-world
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and populate it with all the package dependencies.  Still connected to your VM in your SSH session, type the following commands:

    ```bash  
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    export FLASK_APP=application.py
    # export FLASK_DEBUG=1 
    flask run -h 0.0.0.0
    ```

3.  Now navigate to your new server and you should see your running web application.

    ```HTTP  
       http://yourhostname.cloudapp.net:5000
    ```

## Update your server

1. Connect to your VM in your SSH session. Stop the server by typing `CTRL+C`.
2. Type the following commands:

    ```bash  
    deactivate
    open the git repo
    git pull
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment and start the app

    ```bash  
    source venv/bin/activate
    export FLASK_APP=application.py
    flask run -h 0.0.0.0
    ```
