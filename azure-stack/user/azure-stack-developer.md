# Develop for Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

You can get started developing apps today, even if you don't have access to an Azure Stack environment. Azure Stack delivers Microsoft Azure services that run in your datacenter, which means you can use the same Azure tools and processes to develop on Azure Stack.

## Development considerations

With some preparation, and using the guidance in the following topics, you can use Azure to emulate an Azure Stack environment.

* In Azure, you can create Azure Resource Manager templates that are deployable to Azure Stack. See [template considerations](azure-stack-develop-templates.md) for guidance on developing templates to ensure portability.
* There are differences in service availability and service versioning between Azure and Azure Stack. You can use the [Azure Stack policy module](azure-stack-policy-module.md) to restrict Azure service availability and resource types to what is available in Azure Stack. Constraining services ensures that your apps rely on services available to Azure Stack.
* The [Azure Stack Quickstart Templates](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates) are common scenario examples that show how to develop templates deployable to both Azure and Azure Stack.
