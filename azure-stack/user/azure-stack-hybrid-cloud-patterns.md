# Create hybrid cloud apps with Azure and Azure Stack

Microsoft Azure Stack is an extension of Azure. Azure Stack brings the agility of cloud computing to your on-premises environment and to the edge by enabling a hybrid cloud. You can build hybrid cloud apps in Azure and deploy them to your connected or disconnected datacenter located anywhere.

Microsoft Azure is a consistent hybrid cloud. Azure allows you to reuse code developed in Azure and deploy your app to sovereign Azure clouds and Azure Stack. Applications that span clouds are also referred to as *hybrid applications*.

Hybrid scenarios vary greatly with the resources that are available for development, and span considerations such as geography, security, Internet access, and other considerations. Although these scenarios can't address your specific requirements, they can provide some key guidelines and examples for you to explore implementing hybrid solutions.

You can use the hybrid cloud to handle:
- Sample tiered data.
- SQL Server in Azure and Azure Stack.
- Mongo database end-to-end deployments in Azure and Azure Stack.
- Microsoft Edge artificial intelligence inference void detection.
