# Secure communication with certificates  

Certificates are a means to build secure communication between in-cluster components. AKS on Azure Stack HCI includes zero-touch, out-of-the-box provisioning and management of certificates for the Kubernetes built-in components. 

> [!NOTE]
> This preview release enables secure communication between in-cluster components by replacing self-signed certificates with certificates issued by a certificate authority (CA) for new target clusters. 

## Certificates and CAs

AKS on Azure Stack HCI generates and uses the following certificates and CAs: 

- A CA called the Cluster CA:
  - The API server has a Cluster CA, which signs certificates for one-way communication from the API server to kubelets.
  - Each kubelet also creates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which is signed by the Cluster CA, for communication from the kubelet to the API server
  - The etcd key value store has a certificate signed by the Cluster CA for communication from etcd to the API server 
- The etcd key value store has a CA called the etcd CA, that signs certificates to authenticate and authorize data replication between etcd replicas in the cluster.
- To secure communication between the API server and the extension API server, a front proxy CA is created called Front Proxy CA.

### Certificate provisioning 

Certificate provisioning for kubelets is done using [TLS bootstrapping](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/). For all other certificates, YAML-based key and certificate creation is used. 

- The certificates are stored at /etc/kubernetes/pki
- The keys are RSA 4096, EcdsaCurve: P384 

> [!NOTE]
> The root certificates are valid for 10 years. All other non-root certificates are short-lived and valid for four days.

### Certificate renewal and management

Non-root certificates are automatically renewed. Note that support for certificate revocation is not available in this preview release.

All control plane certificates for Kubernetes are managed, but the following certificates are not:

- Kubelet server certificate 
- Kubeconfig client certificate 

We recommend using [Active Directory single sign-in](./ad-sso.md) for user authentication as a security best practice.

## Enable this capability for your cluster

Use the `-enableCertificateRotation` parameter of the [New-AksHciCluster](./new-akshcicluster.md) command to enable secure communication and automate certificate management as shown below: 

```powershell
New-AksHciCluster -name mynewcluster -enableCertificateRotation 
```

Once you deploy a new cluster with the `-enableCertificateRotation` parameter, you cannot disable this feature. 

## Troubleshoot and maintenance

Refer to the following scripts and documentation for logging and monitoring:

- [Logging](https://github.com/microsoft/AKS-HCI-Apps/tree/main/Logging)
- [Monitoring](https://github.com/microsoft/AKS-HCI-Apps/tree/main/Monitoring#certs-and-keys-monitoring)

For worker nodes, failed certificate renewals are logged by the certificate renewal worker pod. If the certificate renewal continues to fail on a worker node, and the certificates expire, the node will be removed and a new worker node created in its place. 

Here's an example of viewing the logs of a certificate-renewal-worker pod:
*insert PS example*

For control plane nodes, failed certificate renewals are logged by the certificate-renewal-controller pod. If certificates expire on a control plane node, it may eventually become unreachable by other nodes. If all control plane nodes enter this state, the cluster will become inoperable due to a TLS failure. You can confirm whether the cluster has entered this state by trying to access it using `kubectl`, and then verifying that the connection has failed if there's an error message related to expired x509 certificates. 

Here's an example of viewing the logs of a certificate-renewal-controller pod: 
*insert PS example*

Control plane nodes canâ€™t be recreated like worker nodes, but you can use the **Repair-AksHciClusterCerts** module to help fix errors related to expired certificates. If the cluster begins to fail due to expired certificates, run the command as below: 

```powershell
Repair-AksHciClusterCerts -Name mytargetcluster 
```
If the cluster becomes unreachable via `kubectl`, you can find the logs in the /var/log/pods folder.
