# Plan to deploy the Network Controller

>Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2; Windows Server 2019

This topic covers how to plan to deploy the Network Controller via Windows Admin Center on a set of virtual machines (VMs) running the Azure Stack HCI operating system. The Network Controller is a highly available and scalable server role that requires a minimum of three VMs to provide high availability on your network.

   >[!NOTE]
   > We recommend deploying the Network Controller on its own dedicated VMs.

## Network Controller requirements for Azure Stack HCI
The following is required to deploy the Network Controller:
- A VHD for the Azure Stack HCI OS to use to create the Network Controller VMs.
- A domain name and credentials to join the Network Controller VMs to a domain.
- A physical network configuration that matches one of the two following topologies.

    Windows Admin Center creates the configuration within the Hyper-V Host. However, the Management Network must be connected to the host physical adapters according to one of the following two options:

    **Option 1**: A single physical switch connects the Management Network to a physical management adapter on the host, as well as a trunk on the physical adapters that the virtual switch uses:

## Configuration requirements
TBD

## Next steps
Now youâ€™re ready to deploy the Network Controller on VMs running the Azure Stack HCI OS.
