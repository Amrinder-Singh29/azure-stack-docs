# Azure Stack HCI security considerations

>Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2

This topic provides security considerations and recommendations related to the Azure Stack HCI operating system:
- Part 1 covers basic security tools and technologies to harden the operating system, and protect data and identities to efficiently build a secure foundation for your organization. It includes resources available through the Azure Security Center.
- Part 2 covers more advanced security considerations to further strengthen the security posture of your organization in these areas.

## Why are security considerations important?
Security affects everyone in your organization from upper-level management to the information worker. Inadequate security is a real risk for organizations, as a security breach can potentially disrupt all normal business and bring your organization to a halt. The sooner that you can detect a potential attack, the faster you can mitigate any compromise in security.

After researching an environment's weak points to exploit them, an attacker can typically within 24 to 48 hours of the initial compromise escalate privileges to take control of systems on the network. Good security measures harden the systems in the environment to extend the time it takes an attacker to potentially take control from hours to weeks or even months by blocking the attacker's movements. Implementing the security recommendations in this topic position your organization to detect and respond to such attacks as fast as possible.

## Part 1: Build a secure foundation
The following sections recommend security tools and technologies to build a secure foundation for the servers running the Azure Stack HCI operating system in your environment.

### Harden the environment
This section discusses how to protect services running on the operating system:
- **Azure Stack HCI certified hardware** 

### Protect data
This section discusses how to protect data and workloads on the operating system:

### Protect identities
This section discusses how to protect privileged identities:

## Azure Security Center

## Part 2: Add advanced security
The following sections recommend advanced security tools and technologies to further harden the servers running the Azure Stack HCI operating system in your environment.
