# Manage tenant logical networks

>Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2

This topic provides step-by-step instructions on how to use Windows Admin Center to create, update, and delete logical networks after you have deployed Network Controller. A Software Defined Networking (SDN) logical network is a traditional VLAN-based network.

By modelling a VLAN-based network as a SDN logical network, you can apply network policies to workloads that are attached to these networks. For example, you can apply security access control lists (ACLs) to workloads that are attached to SDN logical networks. Applying the ACLs protects your VLAN-based workloads from both external and internal attacks.

## Create a logical network
Use the following steps in Windows Admin Center to create a logical network.
