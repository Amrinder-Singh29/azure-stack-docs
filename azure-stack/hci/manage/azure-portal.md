# Use the Azure portal with Azure Stack HCI

> Applies to Azure Stack HCI v20H2; Windows Server 2019

This topic explains how to connect to the Azure Stack HCI portion of the Azure portal for a global view of your Azure Stack HCI clusters.

## View your clusters in the Azure portal

Log into the Azure portal. If you've registered your cluster, you'll see a new resource representing your cluster. You can now use the Azure portal to manage and monitor your cluster even though your physical infrastructure is hosted on premises.
