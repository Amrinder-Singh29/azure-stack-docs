# Changing languages in Azure Stack HCI

>Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2; Windows Server 2019

You can change your preferred language in Windows Admin Center, a management PC running Windows 10, Microsoft Edge, and the Azure Stack HCI operating system running on the servers that you manage. Windows Admin Center remains in your language of choice regardless of language changes in these other resources.

This article explains how to change the language in:

- Windows 10
- Windows Admin Center
- Microsoft Edge
- Server Core in the Azure Stack HCI operating system

## Change the language in the management PC running Windows 10
You can install a language pack to use for Windows 10, apps, and websites. You also can change your keyboard language, and set an input language in a language-preference order for websites and apps.

Changing either the language that you use in Windows 10 or the keyboard language does not affect the display language in Windows Admin Center.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   > After changing your language in Windows 10, we recommend to set your preferred keyboard language as the default before signing out to avoid potential keyboard input issues.

To learn more, see [Manage the input and display language settings in Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4496404/windows-10-manage-the-input-and-display-language).


## Change the language in Windows Admin Center

## Change the language in Microsoft Edge
You can add supported languages to Microsoft Edge, and reorder your language preferences in the browser. You also can add a foreign language translator extension to the browser to get translations.

To learn more, see [Microsoft Edge language support](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployedge/microsoft-edge-supported-languages).

## Change the language in Server Core
