# Manage tenant virtual networks

>Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2; Windows Server 2019

This topic provides step-by-step instructions on how to use Windows Admin Center to create, update, and delete Hyper-V Network Virtualization (HNV) virtual networks after you have deployed Software Defined Networking (SDN).

HNV helps you isolate tenant networks so that each tenant network is a separate entity. Each entity has no cross-connection possibility, unless you either configure public access workloads or peering between virtual networks.

## Create a virtual network
Use the following steps in Windows Admin Center to create a virtual network.
