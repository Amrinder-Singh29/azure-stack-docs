# Quickstart: Monitor Azure Stack HCI clusters with Windows Admin Center

> Applies to: Windows Server 2019

This topic provides instructions for monitoring the performance of an Azure Stack HCI cluster at a glance by using Windows Admin Center.


## Connect to a cluster using Windows Admin Center

1. In Windows Admin Center, connect to an Azure Stack HCI cluster. The Dashboard will appear, providing alerts and health information about servers, drives and volumes, as well as details about CPU, memory, and storage usage.
2. Scroll down to view cluster performance information such as IOPS and latency by hour, day, week, month, or year.

## Using the Performance Monitor tool

View and compare performance counters for Windows, apps, or devices in real-time.
