<!-- TODO - For each release: add AzS Hub build number, Event Hubs RP version number, & corresponding Event Hubs release notes text/link -->
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before deploying or updating the Event Hubs resource provider (RP), you must ensure you update Azure Stack Hub to a supported version (or deploy the latest Azure Stack Development Kit), if necessary. Be sure to read the RP release notes first, to learn about new functionality, fixes, and any known issues that could affect your deployment.
>
> | Supported Azure Stack Hub version | Event Hubs RP version |
