> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production deployments requiring high availability (HA), we recommend a 2 CU cluster. For non-HA and development/test, you can start with 1 CU.
>
> CU scale-out (smaller-to-larger) is supported via the [Event Hubs Clusters blade in the user portal](/azure-stack/user/event-hubs-quickstart-cluster-portal). For scale-in (larger-to-smaller), contact your operator as this feature is not supported via the user portal.
