> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production deployments requiring high availability (HA), we recommend a 2 CU cluster. For non-HA and development/test, you can start with 1 CU.
>
> CU scale-out (smaller-to-larger) is supported via the user portal. See [Quickstart: Create an Event Hubs cluster using the Azure Stack Hub portal](/azure-stack/user/event-hubs-quickstart-cluster-portal.md) to learn more. For scale-in (larger-to-smaller), contact your operator as this feature is not supported via the user portal.
