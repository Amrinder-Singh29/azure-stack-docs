## Delete a VM with dependencies using PowerShell

In the case where we cannot delete the resource group (either the dependencies are not in the same resource group, or there are other resources ), follow the steps below:

Connect to the your Azure Stack Hub environment.

```powershell
get-help
```

Retrieve the VM information and name of dependencies.

```powershell
get-help
```

Delete the VM.

```powershell
get-help
```

Delete each dependency.

```powershell
get-help
```
