# Azure Stack 1908 update

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems*

This article describes the contents of the 1908 update package. The update includes what's new improvements, and fixes for this release of Azure Stack.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This update package is only for Azure Stack integrated systems. Do not apply this update package to the Azure Stack Development Kit.

## Previous release notes

Starting with the 1908 release, previous versions of release notes are no longer visible in the table of contents on the left. To access older versions of the release notes, select another article (for example, the [Azure Stack overview](azure-stack-overview.md)), then select 1905, 1906, 1907, or 1908 from the version selector at the top of the table of contents on the left. For earlier versions of release notes, see the [Archived release notes](#archived-release-notes) section.

## Build reference

The Azure Stack 1908 update build number is **1.1908.0.20**.

### Update type

For 1908, the underlying operating system on which Azure Stack runs has been updated to Windows Server 2019. This enables core fundamental enhancements, as well as the ability to bring additional capabilities to Azure Stack in the near future.

The Azure Stack 1908 update build type is **Full**. As a result, the 1908 update has a longer runtime than express updates like 1906 and 1907. Exact runtimes for full updates typically depend on the number of nodes that your Azure Stack instance contains, the capacity used on your system by tenant workloads, your system's network connectivity (if connected to the internet), and your system hardware configuration. The 1908 update has had the following expected runtimes in our internal testing: 4 nodes - 42 hours, 8 nodes - 50 hours, 12 nodes - 60 hours, 16 nodes - 70 hours. Update runtimes lasting longer than these expected values are not uncommon and do not require action by Azure Stack operators unless the update fails.

For more information about update build types, see [Manage updates in Azure Stack](azure-stack-updates.md).

- Exact update runtimes typically depend on the capacity used on your system by tenant workloads, your system network connectivity (if connected to the internet), and your system hardware configuration.
- Runtimes lasting longer than expected are not uncommon and do not require action by Azure Stack operators unless the update fails.
- This runtime approximation is specific to the 1908 update and should not be compared to other Azure Stack updates.
