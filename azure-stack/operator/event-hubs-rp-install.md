# How to install Event Hubs on Azure Stack

This article shows you how to download and install the Event Hubs resource provider, making it available to offer to customers for subscription.

## Download packages

Before you can install Event Hubs on Azure Stack, you must download the resource provider and its dependent packages. You have two options depending on your situation or requirements:

- Download Event Hubs under a connected scenario.
- Download Event Hubs under a disconnected or partially connected scenario.

### Download Event Hubs under a connected scenario

Follow these instructions if your Azure Stack has Internet connectivity:

1. Sign in to the Azure Stack administrator portal.
2. Select **Marketplace Management** on the left.
3. Select **Resource providers**.
4. Click **+ Add from Azure**.
5. Search for "Event Hubs" using the search bar.
6. Click on the "Event Hubs" row on the search results. 
7. Select the Event Hubs version you wish to install, then click **Download** at the bottom of the page.

> [!NOTE]
> The download process can take 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the network latency and existing packages on your Azure Stack instance. 

You'll notice that additional software packages are downloaded along with Event Hubs, including:

- Microsoft AzureStack Add-On RP Windows Server INTERNAL ONLY
- PowerShell Desired State Configuration

Once the download process is complete, skip to the [Install Prerequisites section](#install-prerequisites).

### Download Event Hubs under a disconnected or partially connected scenario

This option is necessary when any of the following is true:

- You do not have an Internet connection.
- Your connection is not reliable.
- Your requirements prevent you from directly using Azure Stack to download packages.

1. If you haven't already, follow the instructions in [Disconnected or partially connected scenarios](azure-stack-download-azure-marketplace-item.md#disconnected-or-a-partially-connected-scenario). Here you download the Marketplace Syndication tool, which allows you to download the Event Hubs packages.
2. Run the Marketplace Syndicationi tool (`Export-AzSOfflineMarketplaceItem` PowerShell cmdlet). 
3. After the tool's "Azure Marketplace Items" window opens, find and select "Event Hubs" to download the required packages to your local machine.
4. Once the download finishes, you import the packages to your Azure Stack instance and publish to Marketplace. 

## Installation 

1. If you haven't already, sign in to the Azure Stack administrator portal.
2. Select **Marketplace Management** on the left, then select **Resource providers**.
3. Once Event Hubs and other required software have been downloaded, **Marketplace Management** should show the Event Hubs packages with a status of "Not Installed". There may be other packages that show a status of "Downloaded".

## Next steps

You need to create one or more plans, offers, and subscriptions, before users can use Event Hubs. 

- If this is the first time you're offering a service, start with the [Offer services to users](tutorial-offer-services.md) tutorial. Then continue with the next tutorial, [Test a service offering](tutorial-test-offer.md).
- Once you're familiar with the concept of offering a service, create an offer and plan that includes the Event Hubs resource provider. Then create a subscription for your users, or give them the offer information so they can create their own. For reference, you can also follow the series of articles under the [Service, plan, offer, subscription overview](service-plan-offer-subscription-overview.md).
