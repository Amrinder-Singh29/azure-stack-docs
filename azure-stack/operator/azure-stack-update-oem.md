# Apply Azure Stack original equipment manufacturer (OEM) updates

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems*

You can apply original equipment manufacturer (OEM) updates to your Azure Stack hardware components to receive driver and firmware improvements as well as security patches while minimizing the impact on your users. In this article, you can learn about OEM updates, OEM contact information, and how to apply an OEM update.

## Overview of OEM updates


In addition to Microsoft Azure Stack updates, many OEM will also release updates for your Azure Stack hardware, such as driver and firmware updates. These are referred to as **OEM Package Updates**. To understand whether your OEM releases OEM Package Updates, check your *OEMâ€™s Azure Stack documentation*(link to OEM documentation page).

Starting with Azure Stack update 1905 these OEM package updates are uploaded into the **updateadminaccount** storage account and applied via the Azure Stack Administrator portal. For more information, see Applying OEM Updates (link to subsection)

Ask your original equipment manufacturer (OEM) about their specific notification process to ensure OEM package update notifications reach your organization.

Some hardware vendors may require a *proxy VM* that handles the internal firmware update process. For more information, see [Configure hardware vendor proxy VM](#configure-hardware-vendor-proxy-vm) \[Link to Configure hardware vendor Proxy VM section\]
