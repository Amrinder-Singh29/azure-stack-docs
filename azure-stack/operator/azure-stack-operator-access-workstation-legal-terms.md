# Azure Stack Hub Operator Access Workstation (OAW) (Preview Only)

The Azure Stack Hub Operator Access Workstation ("OAW") serves as a jumpbox virtual machine to access the Azure Stack Stamp via the Base Management Controller (BMC) Management network. 

The OAW is intended to be used by an Azure Stack Cloud Operator to perform a series of possible administrator operations, or to assist Microsoft Support engineers during a customer support call to better assist in troubleshooting. For more information, see [Azure Stack Hub Operator Access Workstation](azure-stack-operator-access-workstation.md).

By downloading the OAW, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the following license terms governing your use of OAW.  

Licensing: [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)

Azure may include preview, beta, or other pre-release features, services, software, or regions offered by Microsoft ("Previews"). Previews are licensed to you as part of your agreement governing use of Azure.

Pursuant to the terms of your Azure subscription, PREVIEWS ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE," AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS AND LIMITED WARRANTY. Previews may not be covered by customer support. Previews may be subject to reduced or different security, compliance and privacy commitments, as further explained in the Microsoft Privacy Statement, Microsoft Azure Trust Center, the Online Services Terms, and any additional notices provided with the Preview. The following terms in the DPA do not apply to Previews: Processing of Personal Data; GDPR, Data Security, and HIPAA Business Associate. Customers should not use Previews to process Personal Data or other data that is subject to heightened legal or regulatory requirements.

Certain named Previews are subject to additional terms set forth below, if any. These Previews are made available to you pursuant to these additional terms, which supplement your agreement governing use of Azure. We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to release a Preview into "General Availability."

You must only use the OAW in connection with your use of the Azure Stack Hub service and appliance.
