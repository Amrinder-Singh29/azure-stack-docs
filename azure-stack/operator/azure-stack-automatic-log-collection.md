# Microsoft Azure Stack automatic log collection


Beginning with the 1906 release, Azure Stack includes an easy way for operators to upload log files for analysis by Customer Support Services. This helps streamline the process for troubleshooting problems. 

Automatic log collection is not enabled by default. Before you can enable it, you need to [configure an Azure storage account](azure-stack-storage-account.md) where the logs can be uploaded. 

## How to collect Azure Stack logs

You can collect diagnostic logs in two different ways:

1. Automatically based on system health conditions
2. Manually based on a specific timeframe between 1-4 hours, up to 7 days in the past.
