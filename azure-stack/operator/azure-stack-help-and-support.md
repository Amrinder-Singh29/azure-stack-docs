# Microsoft Azure Stack Help and support

Beginning with 1905 release, Azure Stack **Help + support** improvements make it easier for operators to research issues, get expert help, or learn more about Azure Stack. 

## Research an issue

At the top of **Help + support** are self-service links to read more about an issue, get info about billing, or see which support options are available.

- **Documentation**. [Azure Stack Operator Documentation](index.yml) includes concepts, how-to topics and tutorials that show how to offer Azure Stack services such as virtual machines, SQL databases, web apps, and more. 

- **Learn about billing**. Get tips for [monitoring usage](azure-stack-usage-reporting.md) and [understanding your bill](azure-stack-billing-and-chargeback.md).

- **Support options**. Azure Stack operators can choose from a range of [Azure support options](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) that can fit the needs of any enterprise. 

## Get expert help 

You can also get help from experts in Microsoft Customer Support and the MSDN Forums, or take online training and improve your own skills.
