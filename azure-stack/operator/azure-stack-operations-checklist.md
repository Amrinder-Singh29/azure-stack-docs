## Azure Stack operations checklist

## Routine daily and weekly operations


Azure Stack operators need to do the following things routinely:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Modify your project to enable exception tracking
> * Identify exceptions for different components of your application
> * View details of an exception
> * Download a snapshot of the exception to Visual Studio for debugging
> * Analyze details of failed requests using query language
> * Create a new work item to correct the faulty code



## Day-to-day operations

> * Identify exceptions for different components of your application
> * View details of an exception
> * Download a snapshot of the exception to Visual Studio for debugging
> * Analyze details of failed requests using query language
