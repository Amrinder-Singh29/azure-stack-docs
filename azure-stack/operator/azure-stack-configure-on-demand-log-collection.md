# Configure on-demand Azure Stack log collection

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems*

As part of troubleshooting, Microsoft Customer Support Services (CSS) may provide a blob container SAS URL that you can use to send logs from an on-demand log collection. 
In this case, follow these steps to configure log collection:

1. Open **Help and support Overview** and click **Collect logs now**. 
1. Choose any 1-4 hour period from the past week, and enter the SAS URL that CSS provided.
