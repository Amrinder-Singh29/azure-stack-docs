# Get Support for Microsoft Azure Stack

This topic covers improvements that make it easier to get support for Microsoft Azure Stack. 

> [!NOTE]
> Because the Azure Stack Technical Development Kit (ASDK) is offered as an evaluation environment, there is no official support from Microsoft Customer Support Services. If you are experiencing an issue, make sure to check the [Azure Stack MSDN Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/home?forum=azurestack) for further assistance and information.  

Beginning with 1905 release, Azure Stack includes more options for operators who need support.

## Documentation

Links to [Azure Stack Operator Documentation](index.yml) for concepts, how-to topics and tutorials that show how to offer virtual machines, SQL databases, web apps, and more. 

## Learn about billing

Azure Stack collects and groups usage data for resources, and the [billing information is available for analysis and charge back](azure-stack-billing-and-chargeback.md). Azure Stack forwards this data to Azure Commerce, which bills you for Azure Stack usage similarly to Azure usage. You can also get usage data and export it to your own billing or charge back system by using a billing adapter, or export it to a business intelligence tool such as Microsoft Power BI.
