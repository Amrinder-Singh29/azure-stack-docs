# Get Support for Microsoft Azure Stack

This topic covers improvements that make it easier to get support for Microsoft Azure Stack. 

> [!NOTE]
> Because the Azure Stack Technical Development Kit (ASDK) is offered as an evaluation environment, there is no official support from Microsoft Customer Support Services. If you are experiencing an issue, make sure to check the [Azure Stack MSDN Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/home?forum=azurestack) for further assistance and information.  

Beginning with 1905 release, Azure Stack has more ways for operators to get help. **Help + Support** helps operators self-service and reduces support requests

## Documentation

Links to [Azure Stack Operator Documentation](index.yml) for concepts, how-to topics and tutorials that show how to offer virtual machines, SQL databases, web apps, and more. 

## Learn about billing

Azure Stack groups usage data for resources, and the billing information is available for [analysis and charge back](azure-stack-billing-and-chargeback.md). You can export usage data to your own charge-back system or business intelligence tools such as Microsoft Power BI. Azure Stack forwards this data to Azure Commerce, which charges for Azure Stack and Azure usage similarly.
