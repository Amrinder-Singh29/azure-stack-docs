# Overview of Azure Stack capacity planning

When evaluating an Azure Stack Solution, there are hardware configuration choices that have a direct impact on the overall capacity of the Azure Stack Cloud. These are the classic choices of CPU, memory density, storage configuration, and overall solution scale or number of servers. Unlike a traditional virtualization solution, the simple arithmetic of these components to determine usable capacity does not apply. The first reason for this is that Azure Stack is architected to host the infrastructure or management components within the solution itself. The second reason is that some of the solution's capacity is reserved in support of resiliency, the updating of the solution's software in a way to minimize disruption of tenant workloads. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This capacity planning information and the [Azure Stack Capacity Planner](https://aka.ms/azstackcapacityplanner) are a starting point for Azure Stack planning and configuration decisions. It is not intended to serve as a substitute for your own investigation and analysis.

An Azure Stack Solution is built as a hyper-converged cluster of compute and storage. The convergence allows for the sharing of the hardware capacity in the cluster, referred to as a *scale unit*. In Azure Stack, a scale unit provides the availability and scalability of resources. A scale unit consists of a set of Azure Stack servers, referred to as *hosts*. The infrastructure software is hosted within a set of VMs and shares the same physical servers as the tenant VMs. All Azure Stack VMs are then managed by the scale unitâ€™s Windows Server clustering technologies and individual Hyper-V instances. The scale unit simplifies the acquisition and management Azure Stack. The scale unit also allows for the movement and scalability of all services (tenant and infrastructure) across Azure Stack.
